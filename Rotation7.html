<h1>Rotation 7 - Cameron Burford</h1>
<h3> Vacumm Forming and Lamination </h3> <hr>
	<center><p>This process of Vacumm forming was easily one of the most physically demanding processes that we did throughout the year.</p></center>
	<center><p>Although hysically demanding it was a rather easy process.</p></center>
	<center><p>The sheets of maple that were laid out were coated in thin layers of clue and then placed on top of a mold within a vacumm bag.</p></center>
	<center><p>When the vacumm was pulled the pressure forced the wood around the form and made the wood take the shape of a board.</p></center>
	<center><p>I kepth the design of the board relatively simple and heres why:</p></center>
	<center><p>I intend for this board to be used as a display piece for one of my cars sponsors, So Scare.</p></center>
	<center><p>This board will be covered in the stickers they produce and will be used to display them at local car meets in Calgary.</p></center>
	<center><p>The boards top has been left untouched in order to provide the most surface area for advertising.</p></center>
