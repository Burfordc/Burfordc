<h1>Rotation 4 - Cameron Burford</h1>
<h3> Laser cutting and Laser Engraving </h3> <hr>

	<p> During this rotation we were tasked with producing 3 things with the laser cutter.</p>
	<p> The first item I produced was the Drift Dialects Clock</p>
	<p> I am a fan of the Drift Dialectscompany and I even contacted the owner.</p>
	<p> The clock will be displayed in their show room and I will be receiving some goods from them in return.</p>

	<p> This rotation we were also tasked with creating two other objects. </p>
	<p> The first item I chose to do was a Ferrari glass. This glass was done with the rotarty tool within the laser cutter.</p>
	<p> The rotary tool and the raster ability of the laser allowed the glass to be engraved. </p>
