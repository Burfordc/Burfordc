<h1>Rotation 4 - Cameron Burford</h1>
<h3> Laser cutting and Laser Engraving </h3> <hr>
<p align="center">
	<p> During this rotation we were tasked with producing 3 things with the laser cutter.</p>
	<p> The first item I produced was the Drift Dialects Clock</p>
	<p> I am a fan of the Drift Dialectscompany and I even contacted the owner.</p>
	<p> The clock will be displayed in their show room and I will be receiving some goods from them in return.</p>
