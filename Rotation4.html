<center><h1>Rotation 4 - Cameron Burford</h1></center>
<center><h3> Laser cutting and Laser Engraving </h3> <hr></center>

	<center><p> During this rotation we were tasked with producing 3 things with the laser cutter.</p></center>
	<center><p> The first item I produced was the Drift Dialects Clock</p></center>
	<center><p> I am a fan of the Drift Dialects company and I even contacted the owner.</p></center>
	<center><p> The clock will be displayed in their show room and I will be receiving some goods from them in return.</p></center>

	<center><p> This rotation we were also tasked with creating two other objects. </p></center>
	<center><p> The first item I chose to do was a Ferrari glass. This glass was done with the rotarty tool within the laser cutter.</p></center>
	<center><p> The rotary tool and the raster ability of the laser allowed the glass to be engraved. </p></center>
