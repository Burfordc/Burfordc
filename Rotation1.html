<center><h3> Group Challenges </h3> <hr></center>
	<center><p> This first rotation of class required us to complete a series of two challenges that were provided to us by Mr. Gerber. Our first chalenge was to create the tallest possible tower out of newspaper.</p></center>
	<center><p> Overall I would say my group was successful during this first challenge. We had a few theories about what we should do in regards to our base. We eventually decided on a shallow cone like structure. </p></center>
	<center><p> We decided to use this method in order to achevie the most surface area contacting the ground, while remaining stable and aerodynamic from multiple directions. </p></center>
	<center><p> My bigest contribution was the use of rolling the paper into longer, stiffer, more durable pieces in order to increase the height. This can be seen in the followng image: </p></center>

	<center><p> Our second challenge consisted of us students attempting to catch a golf ball with a set amount of straws and tape. </p></center>
	<center><p> Although my group was unsuccesfull, I still believe that it was a good way to learn how eachother thinks and processes problems. </p></center>
	<center><p> We initially had a few design problems so at the end we panicked an created a flat 'coffin' for the golf ball to land on top of. Anticipating a failure, we cut up a few of the remaining straws to make confetti when the golf ball hit our contraption. </p></center>
