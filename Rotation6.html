<h1>Rotation 6 - Cameron Burford</h1>
<h3> Vinyl and Sticker Making </h3> <hr>
	<center><p>During this process we were tasked to create a total of four stickers.</p></center>
	<center><p>Two were printed out and then cut, where the other two were cut from a solid piece of vinyl.</p></center>
	<center><p>The first two stickers I made were for a shadow student who helped give me inspiration for the designs.</p></center>
	<center><p>Being a Bruce Lee fan, we decided to outfit his phone case with Bruce Lee and his signature.</p></center>

	<center><p>The following class I then decide to cut out two vinyls for my computer.</p></center>
	<center><p>The first image I chose was one of a Nissan 350z. I chose this image to represent my favorite kind of car</p></center>
	<center><p>The second image that I chose was one of my sponsors logos.</p></center>
	<center><p>Funny enough So Scare represents creativity, a skill that I somewhat lack.</p></center>
