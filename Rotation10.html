<h1>Rotation 10 - Cameron Burford</h1>
<h3>Sewing </h3> <hr>
	<center><p>Sewing is by far the rotation that I was the worst at.</p></center>
	<center><p>This may have been due to the fact that I had limited use of my arm, or I am impatient.</p></center>
	<center><p>Probably both.</p></center>
	<center><p>Nevertheless, the sewing process is relatively easy and consistent.</p></center>
	<center><p>In the end my pants turned out pretty well. The hardest part was sizing and leaving room for adjustment in the end.</p></center>
