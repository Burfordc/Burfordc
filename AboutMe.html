<h1>About Me - Cameron Burford</h1>
<h3> Where i'm from? </h3> <hr>
	<p> I am from Youngstown Ohio, a once booming industrial area on the eastern border of Ohio. Youngstown is about an hour away from the Pittsburgh International Airport.</p>
	<p> Not much has come from Youngstown over the last few years other than the production of the Chevy Cruise. Youngstown is the Pinnacle of a rust belt city.</p>
	<p> Once a booming Steel producer, Youngstown has had a constant decline in economic and social status ever since the steel buisness has gone over seas.</p>
	
<h3> Baseball </h3> <hr>
	<p> Baseball is an incredibly large part of my life and occupies most of my time. On average ill practice for about two or two and a half hours out of the day and then lift for one hour. </p>
	<p> This may seem like a lot for some people but it has always been a passion of mine and does not seem to effect as much as it used too. </p>
	<p> I am currently committed to the University of Dayton which is a Division 1 program located in Dayton, Ohio. While at the University of Dayton i wil be enrolled in their Aerospae Engineering program. </p>
	<p> However, this year I have earned the great opportunity to be considered for the MLB Draft. On January 19th I will be attending a pro showcase hosted by my agent and his facility. </p>
	<p> At this showcase there will be 15 scouts from various Major League teams who are there to watch me and a few other players. </p>
<h3> Engineering and design background </h3> <hr>
	<p> I actually do have some experience in very basic engineering principles and techniques. I have used AutoCad in a variety of situations before. </p>
	<p. During my freshman year I took a mechanical drawing class that gave me a very basic understanding of AutoCad. However, after graduating last year I used AutoCad at a building engineering firm as part of an internship. </p>
	<p> During this internship I used AutoCad to help design buildings, look at pre-exisiting structures, and plan out utilities. I also have used AutoCad to design parts for auto projects I have worked on n the past. </p>

<h3> Why did I take this class? </h3> <hr>
	<p> I took this class in order to help prepare me for college next year and see how my skills stack up against others witin the class. </p>
	<p> I have always had a pretty mechanical mindset. Growing up my dad would build large model aircraft and we even used to own a hobby store which is where i caught my first glimpse of small engineering feats. </p>
	<p> It was always intersting to see some R/C cars top out at near 100 miles per hour. I look forward to working on a variety of projects within this class and i aready ave a few ideas for my final project. </p>
