<h1>Rotation 2 - Cameron Burford</h1>
<h3> Rotation 2 - CAD </h3> <hr>
<p> In this rotation we used fusion 360 to design a few different objects, and extrude a 3d model of them. So far this rotation has been my favorite. </p>
<p> Having cad experience in the past it was fun getting back to it and seeing how it has changed over the last few years. </p>

<p> The Challenge I chose was the hinge. Although a simple piece, hinges are everywhere around us and are arguably one of the most important parts of anything. </p>
