<h1>Rotation 5 - Cameron Burford</h1>
<h3> 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing </h3> <hr>
	<center><p>3D printing is a form of additive maufacturing. Additive manufacturing is a process in which layers of a material are placed on top of eachother.</p></center>
	<center><p>This is different to processes such as subtractive manufacturing. A common example of subtractive is milling or the stock removal method.</p></center>
	<center><p>Additive manufacturing allows for certain objects and designs to be created in a more efficent way.</p></center>
	<center><p>It is also possible for this process to create objects that are impossible for the Subtractive manufacturing process to make.</p></center>
	<center><p>The Makerbot printers used at school have a build plate restriction of 25.2 L x 19.9 W x 15.0 H centimeters or 9.9 L x 7.8 W x 5.9 H inches.</p></hr></center>
	<center><p>The first thing to be made was a combination of an object and my face.</p></center>
	<center><p>My head was scanned and then overlayed onto the hood of a Nissan 350z.</p></center>

	<center><p>This process was completed using a program called Meshmixer.</p></center>
	<center><p>Meshmixer allows the user to combine, edit, and modify 3d designs to be 3D printed.</p><hr></center>
