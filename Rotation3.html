<h1>Rotation 3 - Cameron Burford</h1>
	<center><h3> Garment and Sublimation Printing</h3> <hr></center>
	<center><p> This third rotation of classes was really the first time we were able to make something within the class.</p></center>
	<center><p> The first item we were instructed to make was a t-shirt that can connect the local Hudson OH, area or WRA in some way or form.</p></center>
	<center><p> Naturally not being a creative person, I decided to connect the WRA baseball team and Ohio \ by inlaying a baseball within the state.</p></center>

	<center><p> An additional item that was to be created this rotation was something that was sublimated.</p></center>
	<center><p> Sublimation is the process of printing an image on to a special piece of paper, as well as a specific type of ink.</p></center>
	<center><p> During this process, heat is used to transfer the image on to things such as coasters, and mugs..</p></center>
	<center><p> I decided to make two coasters for my father, both of his Ferrari 348 TS.</p></center>
	<center><p> He claims to enjoy both coasters, and uses them daily.</p></center>
