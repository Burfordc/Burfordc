<h1>Rotation 8 - Cameron Burford</h1>
<h3>Soldering </h3> <hr>
	<center><p>Gowing up my parents used to own a hobby store.</p></center>
	<center><p>That being said I always grew up around electronics, soldering, and tinkering.</p></center>
	<center><p>As weird as it is to say, this rotation really sent me back to my childhood.</p></center>
	<center><p>Soldering came back to me relatively easily and was just a matter of plugging and chugging throughout the assignments.</p></center>
	<center><p>The first project we were to make was a strobe light.</p></center>
	<center><p>This proved to be a easy project and was completed relatively quickly.</p></center>
